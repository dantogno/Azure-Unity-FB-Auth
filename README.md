# Azure-Unity-FB-Auth
This project sends UnityWebRequests to an Azure Function App. 
The Function App uses the Azure Mobile Client SDK to read and write to an Azure Easy Table backend.

The project also includes the Facebook SDK. If you use a supported platform (i.e. mobile), you can login and read and write to authenticated Easy Tables.
